# Buys Computer Classification using Machine Learning üíªüìä

A machine learning project that predicts whether a customer will buy a computer based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics using various classification algorithms.

## üåü Project Overview

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm to predict customer purchasing behavior. The model analyzes customer attributes such as age, income, student status, and credit rating to determine the likelihood of computer purchase, demonstrating KNN algorithm implementation and optimization.

## üöÄ Features

- **KNN algorithm implementation** for customer behavior prediction
- **Customer behavior prediction** based on demographic data
- **Data preprocessing** pipeline for handling categorical and numerical features
- **Model evaluation** with performance metrics and accuracy analysis
- **Advanced visualization** with scatter matrix and 3D scatter plots
- **K-value comparison** with accuracy analysis for different k values
- **K-value optimization** analysis for optimal model performance

## üìä Dataset

The model uses a customer dataset with the following features:
- **Age** - Customer age group (youth, middle_aged, senior)
- **Income** - Income level (high, medium, low)
- **Student** - Student status (yes, no)
- **Credit Rating** - Credit rating (fair, excellent)
- **Buys Computer** - Target variable (yes, no)

## üèóÔ∏è Algorithm Implemented

The project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification algorithm to predict customer purchasing behavior based on similar customer profiles in the dataset.

## üìà Model Performance

KNN Classification Results with K-value optimization:

| K Value | Accuracy 
|---------|----------|
| k=2 | [10 %] | 
| k=4 | [10 %] |
| k=5 | [75 %] |
| k=6 | [50 %] | 
| k=8 | [50 %] |
| k=9 | [50 %] |

**Optimal K Value**: k=5 with 75% accuracy
